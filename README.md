Read about this on my blog https://www.arm64.ca/post/creating-a-resume-in-doom/

## How to use

### Requirements

* Gzdoom: If you're on linux, you can probably install this with your package manager.
* A DOOM2 WAD

### Running the WAD
Depending on where you keep your files, you can run the wad with DOOM2 from your terminal like this:

```sh
gzdoom -iwad ~/.config/gzdoom/DOOM2.WAD -file ~/src/DOOMResume/Resume.wad
```

## Playing

Trying walking through walls with text. There are several hidden areas

## Watching
